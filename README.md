# Chase

Adapted sources of demo NES game 'Chase'

# How to run?

## Mac OS X

Preparations (do it once if you don't have ``cc65`` and related tools):

```
brew install cc65
```

Install ``fceux`` NES emulator, this is optional, but you need it if you want to play resultant ``chase.nes`` file:

```
brew install fceux
```

Compilation:

```
make all
```

Play resultant file:

```
make play
```

## Linux

Installation and compilation is identical to Mac OS X instructions above. Replace brew with packet manager that your OS supports and voila!
